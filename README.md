# CPP Keylogger

As I try to learn CPP, I thought programming this would be fun.

This code uses low level hardware interrupts, meaning that it is very hard to detect/intercept this from logging keys.

As always, **for educational purposes only**. Make sure anyone who you give it to knows full well what it is. Thanks.

Undetected, as you can see from [this virus total scan](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/d4de65282cdef7fc2abfe7eab7142d1d55b7689652241f25f4687995b2aa9b45/detection).

### License

Do whatever you want with it. I learn from looking at other peoples code, so the least I can do in return is provide my code for other people to look at.
